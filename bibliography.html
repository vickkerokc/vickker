I am a student first and these are my teachers. This is not an exhaustive list and I will continue to add to this page as I remember or am inspired. I do not claim to be an expert in any of these philosophies, nor have mastered them. They all live beautifully mashed together within me. Most of my insights in my writing is simply me echoing back what I've learned.&nbsp;</p><hr class="separator separator--long-line"><p><em>Wayne Dyer<br></em>A pioneer in self-development and spiritual psychology, Wayne Dyer’s teachings on intention, manifestation, and self-empowerment have deeply influenced my approach to personal growth and inner transformation across his many books and talks.</p><p><em>Deepak Chopra</em><br>A key voice blending Eastern spirituality and Western science, Deepak Chopra’s explorations of consciousness, healing, and mind-body medicine have informed much of my work in holistic well-being.</p><p><em>Caroline Myss<br></em>A medical intuitive and author, Caroline Myss’s work on energy anatomy and archetypes expanded my understanding of the mind-body-spirit connection and the subtle ways we carry and heal trauma.</p><p><em>Oprah Winfrey<br></em>Through her Super Soul Sunday series, Oprah introduced me to a diverse group of thought leaders like Brené Brown and Dr. Shefali, making this journey toward consciousness and healing feel accessible and mainstream.</p><p><em>Don Miguel Ruiz</em><br>Best known for The Four Agreements, Ruiz’s Toltec wisdom offers simple yet profound guides for living with integrity, freedom, and love, which resonate deeply in my philosophy.</p><p><em>Dr. Shefali Tsabary</em><br>A clinical psychologist known for her mindful approach to parenting and adult relationships, Dr. Shefali’s teachings emphasize awakening the authentic self through conscious awareness and emotional honesty. I'm <em>Certified Conscious Life and Parent Coach</em> through her institution as of 2024.&nbsp;<br></p><hr class="separator separator--long-line"><h2 id="metaphysical">Metaphysical</h2><p><em></em><strong><em>Tarot, Astrology, Feng Shu, I Ching and Human Design</em><br></strong>I was first introduced to tarot, astrology, and numerology by my mother-in-law long before the internet made all this easy to explore. Back then, getting an astrology chart was a real feat! Over the years, I’ve kept up with tarot readings—sometimes doing my own, sometimes guided by the insights of tools like <a href="https://tarot.com" target="_blank">tarot.com</a>, which I’ve been a subscriber to for many years. Astrology has grown with me, and now I use apps like <a href="https://www.thepattern.com/" target="_blank">The Pattern</a> to deepen my understanding. Recently, through an Instagram influencer named Blu and her podcasts, I discovered Gene Keys — which has become a big part of my current study, especially as it connects to Human Design.&nbsp;<br></p><p class="msg msg--highlight">Rudd, R. (2013). <em><a href="https://home.genekeys.com/" target="_blank">The gene keys</a>: Embracing your higher purpose</em>. Overtone Books.<br>A contemplative system based on the I Ching and human design, encouraging self-reflection and unlocking innate potential by moving through “shadows,” “gifts,” and “siddhis” as pathways of personal evolution.<br><br></p><hr class="separator separator--long-line"><h2 id="the-foundationandnbsp">The Foundation&nbsp;</h2><p class="msg msg--highlight">Schucman, H. (1975). <em>A course in miracles</em>. <a href="https://acim.org/" target="_blank">Foundation for Inner Peace</a>.<br>A spiritual self-study text emphasizing forgiveness and a shift from fear to love as the foundation for inner peace.<br></p><figure class="blockquote"><blockquote>My mother-in-law introduced to CIM in 1985. We studied it a lot for several years.&nbsp; I did finally finish the main text.&nbsp; I referenced the workbook for years. It helped unlock the layers of dogma from Mormonism. It was a good first step for me for sure. It isn't light reading. It is a reframing tool to change the lens we use to see ourselves, our fellow humans and the world around us.&nbsp;</blockquote><figcaption>-VL</figcaption></figure><p class="msg msg--highlight">Holmes, E. (1938). <em><a href="https://unitedlife.org" target="_blank">The science of mind</a></em>. Dodd, Mead &amp; Company.<br>A foundational text in the New Thought movement, presenting a philosophy that blends spirituality and metaphysics to teach that thoughts shape reality and that aligning with Divine Mind leads to healing and abundance.<br></p><figure class="blockquote"><blockquote>Studied this with Mother-in-law in late 80's during the CIM time as well. Took classes at the center where we lived. Can't say that I ever read this cover to cover, but it resonated with me and it felt very much an extension of CIM. The classes were group classes and we would share our writings from journaling prompts etc.&nbsp;</blockquote><figcaption>-VL</figcaption></figure><p class="msg msg--highlight">Walsch, N. D. (1996). <em>Conversations with God: An uncommon dialogue (Book 1)</em>. Putnam.<br>A spiritually channeled dialogue in which the author converses with “God,” exploring themes of purpose, love, and the human relationship with divinity, challenging traditional religious doctrine.<br></p><figure class="blockquote"><blockquote>I really don't remember who suggested this book to me. I believe I read it in late 90's or early 2000's.&nbsp; Its an enjoyable read and I related to the humanness of it. I've always believed God or Spirit or whatever isn't really so serious and we've confused a lot over time. Externalizing our spirituality rather than internalizing it.&nbsp;</blockquote><figcaption>-VL</figcaption></figure></div></article><div class="content__comments"><div class="entry-wrapper"></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-center"><a href="disclaimer.html" title="Disclaimer">Disclaimer</a>  - <a href="bibliography.html" title="Bibliography">Bibliography</a></p><p class="align-center">© 2020–2025 vickker.com.
