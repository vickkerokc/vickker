This isn't about 'jumping out of a plane' unexpected. Don't overthink it. Keep it simple. Modify routine. The idea is that we get to see and be seen with fresh eyes.&nbsp;</p><figure class="blockquote"><blockquote><strong>Objective</strong>:<br>Explore and get comfortable with our selves. Love all the pieces and parts of our selves. Let go of shame with regard to physical appearance and perfection.<br><br><strong>Setting the scene</strong>:<br>Just another day. Winding down. Disrupt the normal. Lean into getting physical. We all do these normal every day things. And we think they aren’t things that are sexy. Yet, they can be. Allow your mind to open up to being beautiful and wanted and proceed accordingly.<br><br><strong>Encourages:</strong><br>Getting comfortable in our own skin.<br><br><strong>Min Time Allotment</strong>: 15 min&nbsp;<br></blockquote><figcaption>- Unexpected</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-instructions">The Instructions</h2><p class="msg msg--success">Just another bedtime<br>Getting ready for bed<br>Undress first<br>Walk around naked<br><br>Feel the air on your flesh<br>Naked, natural beauty<br>Nipples erect in the chill<br>In the excitement of possibilities<br><br>Exposed<br>Being watched<br>Brush your teeth<br>Comb your hair<br><br>Nonchalant talking<br>‘How ‘bout them Dodgers’<br>They are sneaking peeks<br>Of your naked sexiness<br><br>Excitement grows<br>Anticipation<br>Go to their side of the bed<br>Make eye contact<br><br>Slide into bed<br>Slip into a body to body hug<br>Safe, warm<br>Let the touching begin<br><br></p><h2 id="variations">Variations</h2><p>Any routine doldrums can be channelled into opening your creativity. Morning routines would be especially fun to change up and bring in some skin. Set the tone for the day and leave healthy anticipation for later. Even dinner routines when it's just the two of ya. Wear only an apron. The goal is to disrupt our set routines of mindlessness with the intention of being seen and touched in our creative physical form.<br><br>Do it when you are home alone as well. Just getting yourself used to your body. Maybe explore touching yourself so you can really get to know the curves and pleasant spots. Definitely work up to touching your vulva and clit and learning how to organism. This is very empowering when it comes to having better experiences with partners.<br><br>Platonic:<br>Even friend and family relationships get into settled routines. Explore how you can shake up ‘the way we’ve always done that" and bring a different experience to it. Maybe play a card game instead of watching a movie. Maybe go to a museum instead of out to dinner. Maybe tell Mom to sit at the table while you prepare dinner or fold the clothes… tell her to chill and enjoy letting someone else take care of her.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p><h2 id="insight">Insight</h2><p>Practice makes perfect. This is for you if you’ve lived your life with rules on how and when physicality happens. Until we lay down old patterns, we aren’t always open to new ideas. So this is a way to practice letting go of old ways of thinking and doing. This is also to get us in touch with our physical body today where it is. We may not love our shape or think that there’s no way anyone will find us attractive. We need to change that narrative. We change by stepping out of our comfort zones and into discovery.<br><br>If you find this super easy and are very comfortable with your body already, then leave some clothes on - try some different outfits. Really work to help your partner find some enjoyment with their body too.<br><br>Remember there is no failing at this. Baby steps are allowed. Continue to explore when you are alone and eventually you will be willing to be fully seen.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p><hr class="separator separator--dots"><p><mark>back to the MOB posts<br></mark></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://vickker.com/tags/mob/">MOB</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://vickker.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://vickker.com/authors/vicki-langford/" rel="author">Vicki Langford</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://vickker.com/slow.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><div><span>Previous</span> Slow</div></a></div><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://vickker.com/surrender.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Surrender</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__comments"><div class="entry-wrapper"></div></div></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p class="align-center"><a href="disclaimer.html" title="Disclaimer">Disclaimer</a>  - <a href="bibliography.html" title="Bibliography">Bibliography</a></p><p class="align-center">© 2020–2025 vickker.com.
