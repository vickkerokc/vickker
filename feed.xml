  <p>
    i'm a big balloon
<br>floating through the air
<br>I have a long string
<br>it flails around
<br>unattached,
<br>I float higher and higher
<br>stuck in the clouds
<br>
<br>please someone grab it
<br>hold it tight,
<br>keep me grounded
<br>
<br>please someone let me go
<br>don't hold me back
<br>
<br>back and forth
<br>hold it
<br>let it go
<br>
<br>the string is my physical form
<br>the balloon is my mental state
<br>I've always had a love-hate relationship with my physical form.
<br>give the string for free to anyone willing to grab it
<br>pull the string away and never let anyone get close
<br>
<br>keep the string taut
<br>maintain a safe distance from its holder
<br>
<br>Wait, I don't need another to keep me grounded
<br>another to prove I'm worthy
<br>I can hold my own string
<br>
<br>holding my string
<br>complete and aware
<br>healthy safe
<br>being my whole self
<br>I show up in the world
<br>grounded and flying high
<br>
<br>
