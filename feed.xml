  <p>
    I’m swimming in the ocean in your eyes
<br>It is vast and wide
<br>Forever it holds me 
<br>I float in that ocean
<br>
<br>The waves carry me 
<br>Gentle breezes
<br>Swaying to and fro
<br>
<br>Even when seas get stormy the sun shines brightly again
<br>And I’m still there floating in the ocean of your eyes
<br>
<br>It is a very comfortable place 
<br>Familiar and safe
<br>I’ve been here before caught in the ocean in your eyes
<br>
<br>Your ocean is expansive
<br>I’m a mere drop of water
<br>Part of something bigger than myself
<br>
<br>The ocean in your eyes is no ones to contain, to control
<br>I’m in awe and wonder
<br>
<br>I see myself in the ocean in your eyes
<br>I wail up in tears
<br>My eyes weep a drop and we swirl together
<br>Not knowing where one begins and the other ends
<br>
<br>Blissfully in wonderment, I witness the beauty and grace
<br>The power and force of the ocean in your eyes
<br>Mesmerized<br>
<br>I shake and tremble with ever-flowing love
<br>The ocean in your eyes belongs to no one
<br>
<br>Not everyone can see it
<br>Nor comprehend the grandeur
<br>Yet you offer it freely
<br>
<br>The ocean in your eyes knows no lack, no scarcity, no limits
<br>
<br>Boundless, formless, space, energy, infinity
<br>The ocean in your eyes reminds me we are not alone
<br>We are part of so much more
<br>
<br>I see also pain in the ocean in your eyes
<br>This conduit that transmits so easily the frequencies of everyone, everything
<br>The ocean in your eyes is a beautiful reflection back to those who are ready to see.
<br>I see myself in the ocean in your eyes in a way I’ve never seen before.
<br>
<br>I choose to see, to look, to feel and do my own work to heal
<br>
<br>You are safe behind the reflection of the ocean in your eyes
<br>You see people looking there, you see what they see, safely behind the reflection
<br>
<br>No one can own the ocean in your eyes
<br>They may try to siphon some for themselves or take a bucket full out
<br>
<br>The ocean in your eyes is abundance, your connection to source
<br>Ever present, it washes over you, it grounds you when you let it
<br>
<br>Thank you for showing me the ocean in your eyes
<br>For letting me swim and swirl
<br>Feel my respect and awe, my deep admiration
<br>
<br>For the ocean in your eyes does not belong to me, to anyone
<br>
<br>The ocean in your eyes is freedom 
<br>Let the ocean breeze guide your waves
<br>Your connection to source, your compass&nbsp;<br>

    <strong>Intro</strong>
<br>I wanted more, From life
<br>I didn’t get to do, everything, i wanted
<br>Cuz I wanted more, from life
<br>I always thought there’d be more time
<br>
<br><strong>V1</strong>
<br>I overcame, my childhood burdens
<br>I learned to, take care of myself
<br>One step at a time, I improvised, Improved my life, My circumstance
<br>Moved to Hollywood, the land of dreams
<br>Made my way, all the way, to Beverly Hills
<br>Swimming pools, movie stars
<br>
<br><strong>PRE</strong>
<br>
<br><strong>V2</strong>
<br>I desired, the finer things in life,
<br>I worked hard, so I could fit in
<br>One event at a time, I connected, saved my money, got fancy clothes
<br>Met movie stars, the rich and famous
<br>Before you know it, I hobnobbing
<br>Beach parties, private clubs
<br>
<br><strong>PRE</strong>
<br><br><strong>Chorus</strong>
<br>Oh so grateful for a good life
<br>Wasn’t always easy, this life
<br>Oh so grateful for a good life
<br>Wasn’t always easy, this life
<br>
<br><strong>V3</strong>
<br>Later in life, I found true love
<br>4th of July, sucking on toes
<br>Hawaii life, became your wife
<br>Our love story, so real, so true
<br>Met all your friends, over all night dinners
<br>Now I’m a valley girl, with 9 step kids
<br>Movie nights, Cadillac margaritas
<br>
<br><strong>Bridge</strong>
<br>Our story, ended way to soon, 
<br>So grateful, life with you
<br>
<br><strong>Chorus out</strong>&nbsp;<br>

    This audio file is from a recording i did using bandlab with just the guitar track and then my vocal.&nbsp; At the time the band practices stopped, I hadn't written lyrics for this piece.&nbsp; This piece ended up being very special as it became a tribute to my sister, Jeannie Larson, who passed in Nov 2023.&nbsp; I got the bulk of the song done in Sep 2023 and my sister was able to hear that.&nbsp; I finished this the night before and the morning of her burial in Jan 2024.&nbsp; This was played at her service.&nbsp; #love

<br>Sometimes I'm the summer breeze

<br>Sometimes my lightning crashes and

<br>All my forms are necessary
<br>They all serve a purpose

<br>I'm all powerful and control nothing
<br>I'm awe inspiring and seek no validation&nbsp;<br>

<br>keep the string taut

    <strong>V1</strong>
<br>We grew apart
<br>Through years of wear
<br>Fighting for so long
<br>
<br>I am playing 
<br>Out old patterns 
<br>I’m bored with myself
<br>
<br>I’m not leaving
<br>Who you are 
<br>I’m finding myself
<br>
<br><strong>PC</strong> 
<br>I’m just going through the motions 
<br>At the end of the day
<br>
<br><strong>Chorus</strong>
<br>At the end of the day
<br>Your love is confining, restraining, limiting
<br>Expects to be a way
<br>A way I've outgrown
<br>At the end of the day
<br>
<br><strong>V2</strong>
<br>Checked the boxes
<br>I was told to check
<br>thought it meant success
<br>
<br>Getting by was 
<br>Me shutting down
<br>Just hiding my pain
<br>
<br>Scared of failure
<br>Scared of the unknown
<br>Cant give up on myself
<br>
<br><strong>PC</strong> 
<br>I’m just going through the motions 
<br>At the end of the day
<br>
<br><strong>Chorus </strong>(2nd time through)
<br>At the end of the day 
<br>My love was exacting, demanding, commanding
<br>Expects me to be a way,
<br>A way I’ve outgrown 
<br>At the end of the day
<br>
<br><strong>BRIDGE</strong>
<br><br><strong>PC</strong> 
<br>I’m DONE going through the motions 
<br>At the end of the day<br>
<br><strong>V3</strong>
<br>Left the comforts
<br>Of an unfulfilling life
<br>Had to build a new
<br>
<br>Piece by piece 
<br>It all fell apart
<br>Something new emerged
<br>
<br>Stripped down
<br>I found my joy
<br>of a life that’s free
<br><br><strong>PC</strong>
<br>I’m NOT going through the motions 
<br>It’s a brand new day

<br>Walking a tightrope
<br>So tired not getting any sleep
<br>Walking a tightrope
<br>My Mind is ..sinking deep
<br>
<br><strong>Pre Chorus&nbsp;</strong><br>I want to have fun 
<br>before I get old
<br>On this tightrope
<br>
<br>I want to be free 
<br>before i go cold
<br>On this tightrope 
<br>
<br><strong>V2</strong><br>Im walking a tightrope
<br>Longing for those summer skies
<br>Im walking a tightrope
<br>Life was so carefree and wild
<br>Im walking a tightrope
<br>Throw all our cares away
<br>Im walking a tightrope
<br>Longing for the long days
<br>
<br><strong>Pre Chorus&nbsp;</strong><br>I want to have fun 
<br>before I get old
<br>On this tightrope
<br>
<br>I want to be free 
<br>before i go cold
<br>On this tightrope<br>
<br><strong>Chorus&nbsp;</strong><br>What's it all for.  
<br>What's it all mean.
<br>The struggle is real
<br>Just a cog in the machine
<br>
<br><strong>Bridge&nbsp;<br></strong>
<br><em>The chorus is the exit</em>
<br>
<br>What's it all for.  
<br>What's it all mean.
<br>Im gonna step off
<br>This tightrope 
<br>For good<br>

    <strong>V1</strong><br>Spinning round and round
<br>lather rinse and  repeat
<br>
<br>days look the same

<br>Going through the motions

<br>And then 
<br>One day

<br>Bammmm

<br>Powww

<br>Awakened
<br>Enlightened

    We made small talk
<br>We shared stories
<br>We talked opinions
<br>We shared philosophy
<br>
<br>We laughed and joked
<br>We teased delightfully
<br>
<br>I had fun but
<br>The only thing wrong with last night
<br>Was too much talking
<br>
<br>Talking is overrated
<br>Talking is a waste of breath
<br>Lets save our breath for a kiss
<br>
<br>Let's put our mouths together 
<br>Breathe in and out
<br>
<br>We conversated
<br>Discussing decisions like 
<br>Should we go to the club tonight
<br>Or just stay home
<br><br>We talked to friends
<br>We talked to strangers
<br>
<br>I had fun but
<br>The only thing wrong with last night
<br>Was too much talking
<br>
<br>Talking is overrated
<br>Talking is a waste of breath
<br>Lets save our breath for a kiss
<br>
<br>Let's put our mouths together 
<br>Breathe in and out
<br>
<br>We discussed work
<br>We worried about money
<br>While we dreamed of vacations 
<br>Lifestyles of the rich and famous
<br><br>We discussed the future
<br>We analysed the past
<br><br>You know what was wrong with last night
<br>Too much talking.
<br>
<br>Talking is overrated
<br>Talking is a waste of breath
<br>Lets save our breath for a kiss
<br><br>The night dragged on and on
<br>Too much talking
<br>
<br>I'm in my head too much
<br>There's a lot of noise in there
<br>
<br>Just hold me now<br>Kissing is better than words.
