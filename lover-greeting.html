It keeps the fires burning. It reinforces to the receiver that they are valued and important. It creates a spark in both parties that carries with us throughout our day. It's foreplay. It is an exercise for the giver to pay tribute and reinforce our love. Expressing our feelings through this physical act reinforces to our partner they turn us on.<br><br>For this make out, there is a giver and a receiver. It is encouraged that both partners are actively taking turns as both giver and receiver.<br>If you are receiving - stop and receive, no need to change the tone or take it to a different level or offer any suggestions. Just let your partner show their love through their greeting. This is an act of spontaneity. Resist the need to direct.<br>For the giver, don’t overplan or schedule this way in advance. If the thought flitters through your brain, follow through. The first time you think to do it might be awkward and that is OK !!!</p><figure class="blockquote"><blockquote>Objective:&nbsp;<br>Give a spontaneous kiss that lingers.<br><br>Setting the scene:&nbsp;<br>Before parting ways in the morning -- At first arrival when upon getting home -- before sitting down for dinner -- before getting in the car after a dinner out<br><br>Encourages:<br>Spontaneity, Expressing joy, gratitude, playfulness<br><br>Min Time Allotment - 2 min&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></blockquote><figcaption>- Lover Greeting</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-instructions">The Instructions</h2><p class="msg msg--success">Can you see<br>Do you hear<br>They are approaching<br>They don’t see you yet.<br><br>You can’t wait<br>That rush of excitement<br>Imagine how you’ve missed them<br>How grateful you are to have them<br>Imagine how you want to delight them<br>Go with the flow<br><br>Rush to them<br>Lock eyes with them<br>Express your emotions<br>Your sounds convey your feelings<br>No judgment<br>Let it flow<br><br>Embrace them hard<br>Feel their body<br>Lock lips passionately<br>Suspend time for a second<br>Timeless<br></p><h2 id="variations">Variations</h2><p>This concept can be adapted to hellos and goodbyes. Use it during any type of transition - where, say you have been working together on a project and now it's time to start on dinner. Pause and reflect and CIAO!<br><br>Platonic: acknowledge your friend, family member with a genuine welcome. Whatever level of touch is appropriate based on your relationship with them - A hug, eye contact, a kiss on the cheek -- heck both cheeks like the Europeans do. Point is to pause and express that you care. That you love them.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p><h2 id="insight">Insight</h2><p>Showing affection might not be your natural method of expressing or receiving love, and that’s okay. Often our partner, however, would benefit from this way of being validated and affirmed by you.<br><br>For the giver:<br>This is a reminder to slow down and express how you feel. Also anticipation is a great aphrodisiac. So, give yourself a chance to “get into the mood” ahead of time.<br><br>If you KNOW your partner doesn’t like surprises then when they walk in tell them you want to give them a kiss when they are ready. Allow them to put their bags down and come to you. Then GIVE them that kiss as spontaneously as you can. No strings attached.<br><br>For the receiver:<br>Can you find a way to allow the spontaneity and potential messiness of this greeting and go with the flow? Don’t try to control this, just receive and allow the moment to wash over you. Receive. They/he/she love me. They really do.<br><br>If it's difficult to muster the joy to give or receive a big, spontaneous Aloha with your partner, ask yourself why? Allow the feelings to come up. Through discovery comes healing. Talk (write) about them. Share your words. Share how you feel when anticipating spending time together? Be honest with yourself and each other. Can you explain it to your partner in such a way so they can understand and adapt so you both feel accepted and loved. Find the version that works best for you both.<br><br><br></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on July 15, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://vickkerokc.github.io/vickker1/tags/mob/">MOB</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://vickkerokc.github.io/vickker1/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://vickkerokc.github.io/vickker1/authors/vicki-langford/" rel="author">Vicki Langford</a></h3></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-next"><a href="https://vickkerokc.github.io/vickker1/playful.html" class="content__nav-link" rel="next"><div><span>Next</span> Playful</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>© 2020–2025 vickker.com.
