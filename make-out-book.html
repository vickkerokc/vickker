He had one then I had one to normalise the incongruence. We stayed together.&nbsp; It was challenging time. But we loved each other and had a lot vested in staying together.&nbsp; Then we morphed into a "I'd rather not know" period. It stayed way in the background until my awakening that began in 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In sharing some of these things, please know I don't hate my first.&nbsp; I love him.&nbsp; There are many layers to a long term relationship of friendship, intimacy, safety, family, parenting, business, success.&nbsp; We weathered many storms together.&nbsp; There was just this layer that lived in the shadows.&nbsp; It was my journey.&nbsp; And this is my story.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When the concept of the Make Out Book was birthed, I had a lot of excitement and a lot of ideas flowed.&nbsp; I talked with several friends over the next year or two about making this book, but it never found any real momentum.&nbsp; Life was happening as well at breakneck speeds.&nbsp; COVID.&nbsp; Then separation.
